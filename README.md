## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I used the classroom videos to help guide me. I knew to create new inputs from the car garage assignment and new I needed to create functions. Getting the monthly cost to go red when it exceeds 20k was challenging. I know I could do better on the css but I was tired.
